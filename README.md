# DocumentFormatting

###
This was just a small task which I had at a company, taking a list of documents IDs for OCR and reformatting it to suit the need (i.e. accuracy report generation/analysis)
Formats Document ID's for OCR using List Comprehension in Python

#### Instructions

- Specify file path of unformatted document
- Specify file path of the created formatted document
- run the code

###### Note

The document templates aren't exactly the same (however they were very similar based of internal software). 
This was designed to be a general solution for this format.
